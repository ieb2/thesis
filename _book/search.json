    "text": "Missing data is an issue ubiquitous in many fields of science. Today, multiple imputation (MI) is one of the most commonly utilized approaches to provide valid statistical inferences in the presence of missing data. Briefly, MI fills the missing cells in the original dataset by generating a series of plausible values based on an imputation model and, thereafter, creates multiple complete versions of the original dataset. Subsequently, the analysis model is applied to each imputed dataset, and the parameters of interest are pooled to accurately reflect the loss of information caused by the missing observations. Accompanying MI, however, is the issue of uncongeniality, which, imprecisely, occurs when the imputation model and the analysis model make different assumptions about the data. Not long after the conception of MI, Rubin’s accompanying set of rules to pool parameter estimates from the multiply imputed datasets was shown to produce biased point estimates under uncongeniality, which led to under-coverage of confidence intervals for anti-conservative estimates of variance or over-coverage for conservative estimates. In response, certain combinations of MI and resampling methods have been proposed as robust variance estimators under uncongeniality; however, their main drawback, to this day, has been their associated computational cost. Moreover, bootstrapping, one of the most commonly utilized resampling methods alongside MI to obtain proper variance estimates, has its basis in asymptotic theory. As such, in small samples frequently encountered in biological studies, the need for a computationally efficient variance estimator with statistically desirable properties remains.\nIn response, a jackknife variance estimator for multiply imputed outcome variables under uncongeniality for small sample sizes is proposed, which provides asymptotically unbiased point estimates with appropriate confidence interval coverage under uncongeniality. The performance of the proposed jackknife variance estimator is investigated using a Monte Carlo simulation study and compared to other methods in the literature. Accordingly, the recommendation to replace Rubin’s rules as the de facto standard in variance estimation with resampling-based robust variance estimators is made, particularly in light of the modern computational power statistical practitioners have at their disposal. Finally, an implementation of the proposed jackknife variance estimator in R is provided."

    "text": "Missing data is a discipline-agnostic issue commonly encountered by statistical practitioners. Given that many statistical procedures require data to be complete (i.e., in the form of an \\(n \\times m\\) matrix), the appropriate course of action to be taken in the presence of missing data has long been investigated by statisticians. Today, multiple imputation is accepted as the gold standard in missing data analysis, thanks to the work of Donald Rubin (Buuren 2012). In 1977, Rubin proposed using multiple completed versions of the dataset with missing observations, applying the complete-data procedure of interest, and pooling the estimates to draw valid inferences (Buuren 2012). The main advantage of multiple imputation, as opposed to single imputation, which had been used by researchers since the early 1970s, is its ability to properly estimate the variance caused by missing observations (Buuren 2012). The emphasis placed on variance and uncertainty by Rubin was a departure from the status quo of the time, which was to fill in the missing observation with the most probable value and to proceed with complete case analyses as if the observation had not been missing, to begin with (Buuren 2012). This approach, however, fails to incorporate the loss of information caused by missing observations into the estimation of parameters, resulting in the underestimation of variance (Rubin 1978).\nLike all revolutionary ideas, multiple imputation received harsh criticism following its conception. Perhaps the most notable of the objections came from Fay in 1992, who demonstrated through counterexamples that multiple imputation produced biased covariance estimates (Bartlett and Hughes 2020). Fay added that the need for unison between the imputation and analysis model made multiple imputation a poor general-purpose tool, particularly in instances where the imputer and analyst are different individuals (Fay 1992; Buuren 2012). Fay’s arguments led to the conceptualization of congeniality between the imputation and analysis model, which was later accepted to be a requirement to obtain valid inferences from multiple imputation using Rubin’s pooling rules (hereafter, Rubin’s rules) (Buuren 2012; Meng 1994). Although Fay’s work initially criticized biases introduced to the covariance matrix following multiple imputation, a similar phenomenon of biased estimations were observed with variance under uncongeniality (Fay 1992; Meng 1994; Xie and Meng 2016).\nSome of the earliest works demonstrating Rubin’s variance estimator to be biased under uncongeniality were from Wang and Robins in 1998, who also proposed an alternate variance estimator in the same paper (Buuren 2012). The variance estimator proposed by Wang and Robins requires the calculation of several quantities, which are not easily accessible to the average statistical practitioner (Bartlett and Hughes 2020). The challenging construction of the variance estimator proposed by Wang and Robins has resulted in it receiving little-to-no attention in applied settings (Bartlett and Hughes 2020). In an attempt to create a more user-friendly variance estimator in instances of suspected uncongeniality, researchers have proposed combining resampling methods with multiple imputation. Of the two main resampling methods, bootstrap has received more attention from multiple imputation researchers compared to jackknife resampling, which has mostly been investigated under single hot-deck imputation. Although particular combinations of bootstrap and multiple imputation have been demonstrated to create asymptotically unbiased estimates of variance, the associated computational cost makes this an active area of research (Bartlett and Hughes 2020). Most recently, von Hippel has proposed a bootstrap variance estimator which addresses the issue of computational cost; however, it has been demonstrated to create confidence intervals that are slightly wider compared to traditional bootstrap and multiple imputation combinations (Bartlett and Hughes 2020). Given the lower computational cost associated with jackknife resampling, as well as desirable properties demonstrated under single imputation, such as being unbiased in certain scenarios, it is an attractive alternative that should be considered as a variance estimator of multiply imputed data under uncongeniality (Chen and Shao 2001; Rao and Shao 1992). More importantly, however, is the advantages jackknife resampling has over bootstrap resampling in small sample sizes, which are frequently encountered in datasets associated with biological studies."

    "text": "2.3 Comparison of Jackknife and Bootstrap Resampling\nGiven their comparable construction and application, the jackknife and bootstrap make similar assumptions regarding the data. Most notably, both assume that the function used to estimate the parameter is smooth. Formally, a smooth function is defined as one that has continuous derivatives over some domain, with the minimum number of derivatives required to be considered smooth varying per the question at hand. From a statistical perspective, if the function used to estimate the parameter is smooth on some domain \\((a, b)\\), \\([F(q_i) - F(q_z)] \\rightarrow 0\\) as \\(\\lvert q_i - q_z\\rvert \\rightarrow 0\\). Meaning, among a set of conceivable, non-identical samples from the population, minor differences between possible samples will only result in minor differences between the statistic estimated. Due to its deterministic nature, the jackknife tends to perform poorly in estimating non-smooth statistics. However, its deterministic nature also yields the jackknife superior to bootstrapping in smaller datasets.\n\n\n\n\nBartlett, Jonathan W, and Rachael A Hughes. 2020. “Bootstrap Inference for Multiple Imputation Under Uncongeniality and Misspecification.” Statistical Methods in Medical Research 29 (12): 3533–46. https://doi.org/10.1177/0962280220932189.\n\n\nBuuren, Stef van. 2012.

However, the properties of bootstrap resampling have their basis in the asymptotic theory, which holds in large sample sizes. The minimum sample size required to utilize bootstrap resampling and obtain asymptotically unbiased estimates is highly context-dependent; in certain situations, a minimum sample size of \\(n = 200\\) has been suggested, with other authors suggesting between \\(n = 100\\) to \\(n = 500\\). Given that in many biological studies, the minimum sample size required for asymptotically unbiased estimates may not be achieved, jackknife resampling, a method that predates the bootstrap, may be considered."
