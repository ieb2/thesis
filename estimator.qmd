# The Proposed Jackknife Estimator

A pseudocode overview of the jackknife estimator proposed may be seen in the following figure.

As part of the algorithm, researchers must choose values $k$ and $j$, which will be context-dependent quantities. Ideally, a $k$ value which satisfies $\frac{\sqrt{n}}{k} \rightarrow 0$ will provide asymptotically unbiased estimates even for non-smooth statistics. Rewriting the foregoing condition for $k$:

$$
\begin{align}
  &\frac{\sqrt{n}}{k} \rightarrow \ 0 \\ 
  &\implies k >> \sqrt{n} \\ 
  &\text{Since} \ k \leq n \\
  &\implies n \geq k >> \sqrt{n}
\end{align}
$$

It is evident that $k$ should take on some value between $n$ and $\sqrt{n}$ with $k$ being closer to $n$, particulary for non-smooth statistics. At any rate, $j = \binom{n}{k}$ will likely be a value that is not computationally feasible to obtain. Again, the number of subsamples required, $j$, can be limited to yield the estimator more accessible. The choice of $j$ will be a multifaceted decision, where higher values are ideal. Ideally, a small pilot value may be performed with a range of $j$ values to determine values of $j$ for which estimates begin to converge.
