# The Proposed Jackknife Estimator {#sec-est}

A pseudocode overview of the jackknife estimator proposed may be seen in the following figure.

Briefly, the algorithm begins by obtaining $j$ jackknife subsamples from the observed dataset with missing observations. Thereafter, each of the $j$ subsamples are imputed $m$ times, resulting in a total of $j \times m$ complete datasets. Subsequently, the analysis model of interest to estimate $\theta$ is applied to each of the completed datasets to produce $\hat{\theta^*}_1, \hat{\theta^*}_2, \hat{\theta^*}_3, \dots, \hat{\theta^*}_{n \choose d}$. The point estimate then becomes the mean of the previously produced $n$ pseudo-estimates, with the confidence interval the $\alpha/2^{th}$ and $1-\alpha/2^{th}$, respectively. 

As part of the algorithm, researchers must choose values $d$ and $j$, which will be context-dependent quantities. Ideally, a $d$ value which satisfies $\frac{\sqrt{n}}{d} \rightarrow 0$ will provide asymptotically unbiased estimates even for non-smooth statistics [@chen_jackknife_2001; @Shao_Wu_1989]. Rewriting the foregoing condition for $d$

\begin{align}
&\frac{\sqrt{n}}{d} \rightarrow \ 0 \\ 
&\implies d >> \sqrt{n} \\ 
&\text{Since} \ d < n \\
&\implies n > d >> \sqrt{n}
\end{align}

It is evident that $d$ should take on some value between $n$ and $\sqrt{n}$ with $d$ being closer to $n$, particularly for non-smooth statistics. At any rate, $j = \binom{n}{d}$ will likely be a value that is not computationally feasible to obtain. As such, the number of subsamples required, $j$, can be limited to yield the estimator more accessible. The choice of $j$ will be a multifaceted decision, where, if possible, greater values are preferred. Ideally, a small pilot study may be performed with a range of $j$ values to determine values of $j$ for which estimates begin to converge. 

Although not as widely applicable, researchers may consider utilizing a delete-one jackknife, as discussed in @sec-del Given the stochastic nature of multiple imputation, especially in instances where a high proportion of missingness is present, the pseudo-estimates may vary widely between any two given jackknife subsamples, similar to what would be observed in the case of percentiles. As such, the delete-one jackknife approach is not recommended for general use but could be considered in samples with low missingness proportion.
